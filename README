This program (reactiveSputter.out) calculates flow (q_0) and yield (Y) and other values needed for their calculation in reactive sputtering processes. it takes inputvalues from input.dat, writes them to output.dat and plots Y over q_0 as well as  the pressure of the reactive gas nitrogen (p_N) over q_0.
invoke variableplot.py and variableplot2.py with python3 variableplot.py
